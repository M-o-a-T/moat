#
# Basic infrastructure to run an RPC system via an unreliable,
# possibly-reordering, and/or stream-based transport
#
# We have a stack of classes, linked by parent/child pointers.
# At the bottom there's some Stream thing, at the top we have the command
# handling, implemented by the classes Request (send a command, wait for
# reply) and Base (receive a command, generate a reply).
#
# Everything is fully asynchronous. Each class has a "run" method which is
# required to call its child's "run", as well as do internal housekeeping
# if required. A "run" method may expect its parent to be operational;
# it gets cancelled if/when that is no longer true. When a child "run"
# terminates, the parent's "run" needs to return.
#
# Incoming messages are handled by the child's "dispatch" method. They
# are expected to be fully asynchronous, i.e. a "run" method that calls
# "dispatch" must use a separate task to do so.
#
# Outgoing messages are handled by the parent's "send" method. Send calls
# return when the data has been sent, implying that sending on an
# unreliable transport will wait for the message to be confirmed. Sending
# may fail.
