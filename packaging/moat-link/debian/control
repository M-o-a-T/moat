Description: A distributed no-master key-value store
 MoaT-Link is a master-less distributed key-value storage system. It uses
 MQTT as a fast-response backend, and adds metadata to ensure that new records
 won't be overwritten with stale data. Messages are encoded with CBOR.
 .
 MoaT-Link does not support data partitioning. Every server stores the whole
 data set.
 .
 MoaT-Link depends on retained MQTT data, but they don't need to be persistent.
 An event log is used to restore a system when restarting.
