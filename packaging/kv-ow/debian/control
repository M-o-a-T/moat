Description: A distributed no-master key-value store
 DistOWFS is a link between 1wire and DistKV.
 .
 It will add all discovered 1wire devices, poll these devices as specified,
 write values that it reads from 1wire to some DistKV entry, monitor a DistKV
 entry and write any updates to 1wire, and work with DistKV's runner system,
 either centrally or distributed.
