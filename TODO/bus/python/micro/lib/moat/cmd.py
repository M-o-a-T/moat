#
# Basic infrastructure to run an RPC system via an unreliable,
# possibly-reordering, and/or stream-based transport
#
# We have a stack of classes, linked by parent/child pointers.
# At the bottom there's some Stream adapter. At the top we have the command
# handling, implemented by the classes Request (send a command, wait for
# reply) and Base (receive a command, generate a reply). Base classes form
# a tree.
#
# Everything is fully asynchronous. Each class has a "run" method which is
# required to call its child's "run", as well as do internal housekeeping
# if required. A "run" method may expect its parent to be operational;
# it gets cancelled if/when that is no longer true. When a child's "run"
# terminates, the parent's "run" needs to return.
#
# Incoming messages are handled by the child's "dispatch" method. They
# are expected to be fully asynchronous, i.e. a "run" method that calls
# "dispatch" must use a separate task to do so.
#
# Outgoing messages are handled by the parent's "send" method. Send calls
# return when the data has been sent, implying that sending on an
# unreliable transport will wait for the message to be confirmed. Sending
# may fail.


class BaseCmd(_Stacked):
    # Request/response handler (server side)
    #
    # This is attached as a child to the Request object.
    #
    # Incoming requests call `cmd_*` with `*` being the action. If the
    # action is a string, the complete string is tried first, then
    # the first character. Otherwise (action is a list) the first
    # element is used as-is.
    #
    # If the action is empty, call the `cmd` method instead. Otherwise if
    # no method is found return an error.
    #
    # Attach a sub-base directly to their parents by setting their
    # `cmd_XX` property to it.
    #
    # The `send` method simply forwards to its parent, for convenience.
    #
    # This is the toplevel entry point. You build a request stack by piling
    # modules on top of each other; the final one is a Request. On top of
    # that Request you stack Base subclasses according to the functions you
    # need.
