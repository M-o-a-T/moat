path: !P error.link.mqtt.topic:
title: incompatible topic
doc: |2
  The topic of an incoming message could not be parsed by moat.util.Path,

_path: !P run.service.down.*
title: Death notice for the main service

  interpreted as Markdown.

  Documentation about MoaT command line usage is located in ``moat.doc.shell``.
