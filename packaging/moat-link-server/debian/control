Description: A distributed no-master key-value store
 MoaT-KV is a master-less distributed key-value storage system. It
 circumvents the CAP theorem by assuming that keys are usually only changed
 by one node. It is resistant to partitioning and intended to be always-on;
 while it might delay – but will not lose – any updates.
 .
 MoaT-KV does not support data partitioning. Every node stores the whole
 data set and can instantly deliver mostly-uptodate data.
 .
 MoaT-KV does not have a disk-based storage backend; periodic snapshots and/or
 its event log are used to restore a system, if necessary.
