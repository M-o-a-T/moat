"""
This package implements some basic infrastructure for handling data
streams in a structured manner. It contains three distinct classes:

- `BaseMsg` transports Python objects, using `send` and `recv`.
- `BaseBlk` transports delimited bytestrings, using `snd` and `rcv`.
- `BaseBuf` transports undelimited bytestrings, using `wr` and `rd`.

Additionally, message- and block-based classes understand `cwr` and `crd`
which transport out-of-band data. Typically these contain raw console bytes
that are interleaved with structured data; they are used on channels which
needs to multiplex both.

The common theme for using these classes is

- You assemble a communication stack bottom-up: start with a serial link;
  add packetizing, retransmission, and an object-codec.
- Using the top level as an async context managers establishes the complete
  stack; leaving the context tears it down.
- Most likely, connect the result to a [Base]MsgHandler.

Everything is fully asynchronous. There is no "new incoming data" callback:
it's the upper layer's job to repeatedly call the appropriate method to
read or receive new messages.

A `wrap` method provides a secondary context that can be used for
a persistent outer context, e.g. to keep a listening socket open.
