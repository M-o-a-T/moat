Description: talk to MoaT satellites running MicroPython
  Satellites run a main task which loads some applications. These apps  
  might do something locally, e.g. let a LED blink or poll a button, provide
  a link to a remote system, or call other apps for high-level functions.
  .
  Apps are connected hierarchically. They can send messages to each other;
  a message may return a reply ("read this temperature").
  .
  Multiple replies ("read this temperature every ten seconds") are supported.
  .
  All app-related code is written in async Python. We use ``anyio`` on the
  multiplexer and native asyncio on the MCUs; a shallow compatibility layer
  ensures that most code can be shared.
