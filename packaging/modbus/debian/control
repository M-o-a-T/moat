Description: An async modbus client/server library
 This is an anyio-enabled async frontend for pymodbus.
 .
 This module diverges from `pymodbus` in that it does not expose a data
 store, context to the user. Instead, every bus value is a separate object,
 with arbitrary length and encapsulating its encoding and decoding rules.
 .
 This module was previously named "asyncmodbus".
