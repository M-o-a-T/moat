# Code of Conduct

This project doesn not have a CoC document of its own.

See the [Contributer Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org)
for inspiration.


## Some random guidelines

Respect towards individuals (until they demonstrate that they don't deserve
it) is not the same as not calling out broken code and crazy ideas for what
they are.

Electronic communication lacks the immediate feedback of personal
interaction. Keep that in mind and cool down a bunch of hours before you
blast off about some buggy code snippet, no matter how hare-brained it may
appear to you.

Cool down a bunch of decades before you blast off against a person.
