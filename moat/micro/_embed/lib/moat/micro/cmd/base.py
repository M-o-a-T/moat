"""
Basic infrastructure to run an RPC system via an unreliable,
possibly-reordering, and/or stream-based transport

We have a stack of classes. At the top there's the adapting App, a subclass
of CmdMsg. Linked to it via a chain of *Msg…Buf modules there's a
*Buf adapter that affords an external interface.

Everything is fully asynchronous. Each class is an async context manager,
responsible for managing the contexts of its sub-app(s) / linked stream(s).

Incoming messages are handled by the child's "dispatch" method. They
are expected to be fully asynchronous, i.e. a "run" method that calls
"dispatch" must use a separate task to do so.

Outgoing messages are handled by the parent's "send" method. Send calls
return when the data has been sent, implying that sending on an
unreliable transport will wait for the message to be confirmed. Sending
may fail.
